print("Writing a short story for me is hard because I tend to direcly write whats on my mind so need a specific topic to think a logic response.")
print("It gets harder if the response I need to give is more emotional not because im saying I dont have emotions just that writing about them gets way harder")
print("Logical writting is the best for me because I get to dump my brain out on a topic I think.")
print("So to make this easier I just wrote a story of what I though while writing the story,")
